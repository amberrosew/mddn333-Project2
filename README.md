I've now gone and edited the CSS files for a few of the badges so the grids (and code on the corresponding HTML page) is far more efficient. I also made it so that the counter actually functions. It does revert back everytime you refresh the page, but as it's just there to suggest that things are being tracked I'm okay with that.
