I've worked on the rest of the pages and while I'm not quite finished the "your internet summary" page, I've got the basic outline of it done. I've been struggling with spacing so my code has an awful amount of breaks - this is basically because I didn't have a good grasp on grids when I did the first 2 pages so the css and html files aren't set up great, but now I've got them looking pretty good if I change the css file and make it have a good grid layout it completely screws up those pages. I would re-do them if I had more time, but unfortunately since I changed my idea fairly last-minute I don't have time for that. So I've got messy and inefficient code, but it works and for the purposes of this assignment it's fine. Now I need to finish the internet summary page, create the "blacklist webistes" page, and then refine the visuals and hopefully figure out a little bit of functionality
