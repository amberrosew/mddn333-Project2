# how do you use the internet

This is a speculative design prototype. It's intended purpose is to track users internet usage and display it through various points systems, leaderboards, and allow users to earn badges to represent them reaching certain milestones of internet usage. The overall purpose is to make people more aware of how they use the internet, and how much time they spend online.
